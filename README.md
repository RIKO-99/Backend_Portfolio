##### Introduction
The AirCode Serverless E-Commerce REST API is a backend project developed using Node.js, MongoDB, JWT, and Stripe API. Leveraging the AirCode platform's intuitive in-browser IDE and pre-configured cloud services, this project streamlines the development and deployment of Node.js applications, specifically tailored for full-stack engineers. AirCode takes care of backend technology selection, environment setup, and operation, allowing developers to focus solely on building great products.

### Key Features
Authentication & Authorization: Implement secure user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Database Integration: Seamlessly integrate with MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.

Payment Processing: Handle payment transactions securely using the Stripe API.

AirCode Cloud Functions: Utilize AirCode's cloud functions as the basic unit of deployment. No need to worry about infrastructure, environment setup, or online operation. Write, debug, and deploy Node.js code directly from the intuitive in-browser IDE.

Serverless Architecture: Built upon serverless principles, AirCode's cloud functions offer automatic scaling capabilities, enabling quick adaptation to traffic peaks and resource optimization.
